Description: Taking a Data Frame as input, the package first takes each row and 
    transforms it into a list of edges (in matrix format).
    Each matrix (for each row) is then binded together. Then it removes
    duplicate rows (edges).
    Finally it takes said list of edges and sets it as an igraph graph object.
